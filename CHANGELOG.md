## [2.0.0] - 2023-06-28

### Added
* Add new general-purpose API to library, not specific to CLI consumers.
* Add types to avoid depending upon `casper-node` and `casper-execution-engine` crates.
* Add support for new node RPC method `info_get_chainspec`, used in the binary's new `get-chainspec` subcommand.
* Add support for new node RPC method `info_get_status`, used in the binary's new `get-node-status` subcommand.
